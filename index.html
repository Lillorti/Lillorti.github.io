  <p>[A trend I noticed in healthcare technology is that most solutions created are physical and that's what makes it easy 
    to incorporate physical technical solutions to healthcare including Robotic technology. 
]</p> <p>[Robotic technology is exciting to see since it creates room for high accuracy,safety, 
    and innovation for technology to help with either surgeries or replacing limbs. 
    This also opens more career opportunities in computer science/engineering, electronic engineering, nursing 
    or any other health science degrees to broaden their knowledge.]</p> <p>[This is interesting to me 
      because I gravitate more towards health advancements with the use of technology because I envision
